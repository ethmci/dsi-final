1. 

2. Research Question and Exploratory Data Analysis

3. Importance

4. Methodology

5. Results

```{r regression models}
#REGRESSION MODEL
summary(lm(tgss$ADVFRONT ~ tgss$RELIG + tgss$POLVIEWS + tgss$INCOME + tgss$SEX + tgss$DEGREE + tgss$AGE + tgss$RACE, weights = tgss$WTSSALL))

#REGRESSION MODEL for SCI KNOWLEDGE
summary(lm(tgss$sciknowledge ~ tgss$RELIG + tgss$POLVIEWS + tgss$INCOME + tgss$SEX + tgss$DEGREE + tgss$AGE + tgss$RACE, weights = tgss$WTSSALL))

```

a) understand the
analysis, b) be motivated about the importance of the question, and c) comprehend the intellectual debate in
1
which the paper participates. It is difficult to imagine doing this well, and describe your methods, results,
and interpretations in under 5 pages. Aim for quality.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(Hmisc)
library(descr)
library(weights)

gss <- read_sav("~/gss_spss_with_codebook/GSS7218_R2.sav")

```


```{r, cache = TRUE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## GSS Dataset 

```{r cars}

tgss <- select(gss, YEAR, POLVIEWS, INCOME, SEX, DEGREE, AGE, RACE, HOTCORE,  RADIOACT, 
               EVOLVED, CONDRIFT, VIRUSES, ELECTRON, LASERS, BOYORGRL, ADVFRONT, RELIG)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
